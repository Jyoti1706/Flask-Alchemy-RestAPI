'''
resource is an external representation of intity.
 It is similar to an object instance in an object-oriented programming language,
 with the important difference that only a few standard methods are defined for the resource
 (corresponding to the standard HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods),
 while an object instance typically has many methods.
